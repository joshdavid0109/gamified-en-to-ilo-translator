You are welcome.

Glad to help.
That's all right.
It's alright.
Not a problem.
That's absolutely fine.
Certainly
I'm sorry I'm busy.
That's not going to work for me.
Maybe next time.
I'd love to – but can't.
My body say yes, but my heart say no.
That doesn't work for me.
I wish I could make it work.
I really appreciate you asking me, bu t I can't do it.
I'm not able to commit to that right now.
I just don't have that to give right now.
I want to, but I'm unable to.
I'd like to, but I know I'II regret it.
I'm in a season of NO.
Sounds tempting, but I'II have to pass.
I am honoured that you asked me but I can't do it.
I really appreciate you asking me but I can't commit to that right now.
No, thanks.
Thanks for thinking of me but I can't
Unfortunately not.
I'm afraid I can't.
Maybe another time.
Not possible.
By no means.
I'm slammed.
Not for me, thanks.
Unfortunately, that's not something I can do at this time.
I'm really booked.
Thanks for thinking of me. I really wish I could.
That's not an option.
This is not negotiable.
I think not.
If only it worked, but ...
Not for me my friend, thanks.
I have something else.
Certainly not.
Nope
Nah
Sorry
Not now
Not this time
By no means.
I'm taking some time.
That's better than ever.
That's first class work.
I'm impressed.
That's clever!
Way to go.

You're doing fine.
That's a real work of art.
You certainly did well today.
Way to go.
I like that.
That's it.

That's how to handle that.
Now that's what I call a fine job.
That's great.
Right on!
You're really improving.
You're doing beautifully!
SUPERB!
Good remembering.
You've got that down pat.
You certainly did well today.
That kind of work makes me happy.
It's such a pleasure to teach when
You've just about mastered that.
That's an interesting way of looking at it.
That's really nice.
You are the best.
You are genius.
That's the way.
You are doing beautifully.
You are the just about mastered that.
I'm happy to see you working like that.
That is the better than ever.
You are really improving.

Now you have the hang of it!
That's the best ever.
